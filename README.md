WASTL Mobile
============

The already existing web-app (http://mobile.leitstelle122.at/) of WASTL - shortened for "<strong>Wa</strong>rn- und Alarm<strong>st</strong>ufen<strong>l</strong>iste" in German - is used to display several realtime information of currently running fire brigade incidents in Lower Austria. The incident data is kindly provided by the voluntary fire department "Freiwillige Feuerwehr Krems". WASTL is a project by several public sector entities:

> Die Warn- und Alarmstufenliste ist ein gemeinsames Projekt des NÖ Landesfeuerwehrverbandes, der NÖ Landesregierung, des Bundesrechenzentrums, des Bezirksfeuerwehrkommandos Krems, des Magistrates der Stadt Krems sowie der Freiwilligen Feuerwehr Krems.

This project aims to build an modern mobile web app based on the framework ionic (http://ionicframework.com/) to improve the functionality of the existing solution. The new resulting mobile app should be available in several app stores for different mobile platforms.
